# Introduction to Stalmer1

Stalmer1 is a powerful, opinionated tool that streamlines the creation of full-stack web applications. By using a simple, declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL), you can define your application's data models, pages, and business logic, and Stalmer1 will generate a complete, production-ready codebase.

## The Philosophy: DSL as the Source of Truth

The core principle of Stalmer1 is that the DSL is the single source of truth for your application. Instead of manually writing boilerplate code for your frontend, backend, and database, you define your application in a high-level, human-readable format. This approach has several key advantages:

- **Speed**: Generate a complete application in minutes, not weeks.
- **Consistency**: The generated code follows best practices and a consistent architectural pattern.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to your application are made in the DSL, ensuring that the entire codebase remains in sync.

## What You Can Build

Stalmer1 is ideal for a wide range of applications, including:

- **Internal Tools**: Quickly build custom admin panels, dashboards, and other internal tools.
- **CRUD Applications**: Effortlessly create applications that perform create, read, update, and delete operations on a database.
- **Prototypes and MVPs**: Rapidly build and iterate on new product ideas.

## The Technology Stack

Stalmer1 generates a modern, robust technology stack:

- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Backend**: NestJS with Prisma
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite
- **Authentication**: JWT, Clerk, or Auth0
- **Deployment**: Docker and Helm
